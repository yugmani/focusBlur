# focusBlur

1. Create an HTML page. Add the necessary script tags to point to an external javascript file. Add code so that there is a text box for a phone number with an id of "pn and text area for an address. Beside the phone number text box, there will be an empty span tag with an id of "reminder".  

2. Create an external Javascript file. Get the "pn" and "reminder" elements by their ids and assign them to the variables. 
3. When pn receives focus, change the innerHTML of rm to the text "Format:123-456-7890." When pn is blurred, change the innerHTML of rm to an empty string ("").
4. Load the HTML page in your browser. Click inside the text box and a reminder message should appera next to it. Click the text area afterward to blur the text box and make the message disappear.
